Description

This Python Chanllenge consists of 2 seperate projects: PyBank and PyPoll

PyBank is an analysis of monthly profit and loss data over a 7 year span. This data was imported from a CSV file and exported to a Text file for ease in comprehension. I analyzed the CSV data with the use of for loops, lists and various functions within Python to determine the total months recorded, total profits/losses, the average change in profits and losses each month, and the months of greatest increase and decrease in change as well as those values

PyPoll is an analysis of election data. This data was also imported from a CSV and exported to a Text file. I analyzed the CSV using lists, for loops, if statements and various functions within Python to determine the names of the candidates, the total numbe of votes, the number of votes and percentage of votes each candidate received and the winner of the election.

When exporting to a text file, I used the following website as a reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36571560/directing-print-output-to-a-txt-file
We learned how to export to a CSV in class, but the process to export to a Text file was quite different.
